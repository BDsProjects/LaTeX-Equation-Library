# LaTeX-Equation-Library
A library of the equations I write for my thesis, other projects, etc. This is done in Overleaf, using the compiler pdfLaTeX, Tex Live version 2025, and I do currently have the premium student plan at the time I wrote this README. 

It will be updated whenever I make new equations, feel free to fork it and add more as well.
